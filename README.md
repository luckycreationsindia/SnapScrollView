Custom viewGroup with scroll which snaps the view to start(top) of each child.

The child or inner views can be directly added to the parent. To set the margins of the child, use "setChildMargins(int,int,int,int)" or separately add each margin by using "childTopMargin(int)","childLeftMargin(int)",childBottomMargin(int)",childRightMargin(int)".
